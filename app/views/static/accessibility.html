      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Reporting accessibility problems with this service</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">We are continuing to improve the accessibility of this service. Contact us if you have accessibility requirements that are not listed on this page.</p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Enforcement procedure</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the ‘accessibility regulations’). If you’re not
        happy with how we respond to your complaint,
        <a href="https://www.equalityadvisoryservice.com/">contact the Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS)</a>.</p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Technical information about this service’s accessibility</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">Companies House is committed to making its website accessible in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">This service is fully compliant with the

        AA standard.</p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">PDFs and other documents</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">Many of our PDFs do not meet accessibility standards - for example, they may not be structured so they’re accessible to a screen reader. This does not meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 4.1.2 (name, role value). We are
        investigating a solution to this problem and will update this statement in due course.</p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How we tested this service</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">We regularly carry out internal tests for compliance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines V2.1 level A and level AA using a variety of manual and automated testing tools.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">This service was last audited on 21 April 2020. The audit was carried out internally. We tested all the screens from start page to confirmation of submission.
