<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How to upload documents usually filed together</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">For now, you can only upload one document at a time in this service.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">If you need to upload a package of documents that you would usually file together, you must upload each document separately. This means you must start the service again for each document you need to upload. You can either
  restart the service or use the link on the confirmation page after you've uploaded a document.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">You should do this as soon as possible after you’ve uploaded the previous document so that associated documents can be processed together. Otherwise, some documents may be rejected for missing the required supporting documents.</p>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Reduction of capital (SH19) forms and supporting documents</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">If you need associated reduction of capital documents to be processed together, you should:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>upload supporting documents first, one at a time (the resolution, solvency statement and statement by directors as applicable)</li>
  <li>upload the SH19 form last, after you have uploaded the supporting documents</li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">You should upload each document as soon as possible after the previous document was uploaded. You can either restart the service or use the link on the confirmation page after you've uploaded a document.</p>
<div class="govuk-inset-text">
  You cannot use this service if your SH19 form is supported by a court order. If your form is supported by a court order, you must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/companies-house/about/access-and-opening" class="govuk-link">send all documents to us by post</a>.
</div>
<p class="govuk-body">You can

  <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Standard or same day service</h4>
  <p class="govuk-body">You have the option of a standard service or a same day service when you upload an SH19 document.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">The standard service costs £10. The SH19 is processed within 10 to 14 days.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">The same day service costs £50. The SH19 is processed on the same working day it's uploaded if we receive it by 11am. You must also upload the relevant resolution and solvency statement by this time. If you upload the SH19 and relevant documents after 11am, we will process them the next working day.</p>


<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Documents that need evidence</h2>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">RP07 and LL RP07 - Apply to change a company's disputed registered office address</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">You must include evidence to support your application. Your evidence can be copies of original documents. You can upload up to 9 files of supporting evidence in the service. Applications submitted without evidence will be rejected.</p>
<h4 class="govuk-heading-s">The evidence we need for a person or service provider where the address is being used without permission</h4>
<p class="govuk-body">The evidence we can accept may include:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>documents showing the applicant’s proprietary rights in the address, including leasehold or freehold</li>
  <li>a written agreement which entitles the applicant to use the address</li>
  <li>a utility bill sent to the applicant at the address dated within the last 6 months</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="govuk-heading-s">The evidence we need for a service provider who had a contract with the company which is now terminated</h4>
<p class="govuk-body">The evidence we can accept may include:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>written evidence of the start and end of the contract, which might include the applicant's request for service, an invoice that shows proof of payment or any other evidence of the company’s direct involvement</li>
  <li>a copy of the signed contract and the termination letter</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Documents that have a fee</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">Some documents have a filing fee. You can check if the document you want to upload has a fee:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>on the document itself</li>
  <li>in the ‘Documents you can upload’ section of this guidance</li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">You can pay for the document in the service by debit or credit card if it has a fee. You cannot pay with a Companies House payment account in this service.</p>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Refunds</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">If your document is rejected, we will refund your fee to the original payment method. This can take up to 7 days.</p>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What happens next</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">We'll send you a confirmation email to let you know if the document has been uploaded. An examiner will then process the uploaded document to check if it's acceptable for filing. The document will be registered with the date it
  was uploaded to Companies House as long as it is acceptable.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">We'll email you to tell you if the document is acceptable for filing. If the document is not acceptable for filing, we'll email you to let you know what to do next.</p>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Registrar's powers documents</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">If the document is acceptable for filing, we’ll send a letter to tell you when we have started to review your case and explain what happens next. If the document is not acceptable, we'll email you to let you know what to do next.</p>
