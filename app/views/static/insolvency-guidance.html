        <p class="govuk-body">To use this service to upload an insolvency document, you must:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>be a registered insolvency practitioner (IP) or the Official Receiver</li>
          <li>have your email address in the Insolvency Practitioner (IP) Directory held by the Insolvency Service</li>
              </ul>
          <p class="govuk-body">You should contact the Insolvency Service if you’re an IP who needs to upload an insolvency document and:</p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>your email address is not in the IP Directory</li>
            <li>you’re not sure if your email address is in the IP Directory</li>
            <li>you need to update your email address in the IP Directory</li>
                </ul>

          <p class="govuk-body">If you contact The Insolvency Service to add or update your email address, ask them to let Companies House know when your details have been amended. We can then give you access to upload an insolvency document using the service.</p>
                </ul>
          <p class="govuk-body">If you have contacted the Insolvency Service to give them your email address and you are still unable to upload insolvency documents in the service, <a class="#" href="static/guidance">contact Companies House</a>.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">We’ll send you a confirmation email to let you know if your document has been uploaded. An examiner will then process the uploaded document to check if it's acceptable for filing.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">If your document is acceptable for filing, we’ll email you to let you know. The document will be registered with the date it was uploaded to Companies House. This means your document is registered sooner than if you sent it by post.</p>
