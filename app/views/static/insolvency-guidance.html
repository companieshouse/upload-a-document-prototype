        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>be a registered insolvency practitioner (IP) or the Official Receiver</li>
          <li>have your email address in the Insolvency Practitioner (IP) Directory held by the Insolvency Service</li>
              </ul>
          <p class="govuk-body">You should contact the Insolvency Service if you’re an IP who needs to upload an insolvency document and:</p>

            <li>your email address is not in the IP Directory</li>
            <li>you’re not sure if your email address is in the IP Directory</li>
            <li>you need to update your email address in the IP Directory</li>

                }) }}
          <p class="govuk-body">If you contact the Insolvency Service to add or update your email address, ask them to let Companies House know when your details have been amended. We can then give you access to upload an insolvency document using the service.</p>
                </ul>
          <p class="govuk-body">If you have contacted the Insolvency Service to give them your email address and you are still unable to upload insolvency documents in the service, <a class="#" href="static/guidance">contact Companies House</a>.</p>

          <p class="govuk-body">You must complete the document in advance. Save it to the device you are using in a PDF format so that it is ready to upload. The file must be less than 6MB.</p>
          {{ govukInsetText({

        <p class="govuk-body">You can only upload one document at a time. If you need to upload more than one document, for example as part of a package, you must start a new transaction for each document you upload.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Continuation pages</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">If you need to include continuation pages with your submission, you must merge the document and the continuation pages first. This enables you to upload them as one document.</p>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How to upload documents usually filed together</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">For now, you can only upload one document at a time in this service.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">If you need to upload a package of documents that you would usually file together, you must upload each document separately. This means you must start the service again for each document you need to upload. You can either restart the service or use the link on the confirmation page after you've uploaded a document.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">You should do this as soon as possible after you’ve uploaded the previous document so that associated documents can be processed together.</p>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Documents that need to be merged</h3>
  <p class="govuk-body">The following insolvency documents need to be merged first and then uploaded as a single PDF document:</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Merge the documents with form 2.16B(NI) at the front, followed by form 2.14B(NI).</p>
